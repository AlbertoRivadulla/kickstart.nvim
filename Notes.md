# Configure and install plugins
 To check the current status of your plugins, run
   ```:Lazy```

# Loading plugins
Plugins can be configured to **run Lua code** when they are loaded. This is often very useful to both group configuration, 
as well as handle lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
For example, in the configuration for `folke/which-key.nvim` we use:
    ```event = 'VimEnter'```
which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be normal autocommands events 
(`:help autocmd-events`). Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs after the plugin has 
been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

Plugins can **specify dependencies**. The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything you do for a 
plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin
